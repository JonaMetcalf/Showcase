{"intro": "The aim of this work was to investigate how the size and geometry of landslides effect their final deposit height and maximum runout distance. This is explored with numerical simulations that use the Material Point Method (MPM) in single, two-phase, and three dimensional problems. These simulations were run with different mesh sizes and number of material points per mesh element and were compared to lab measurements to determine the simulations' accuracy and judge whether MPM is a viable method for engineering simualtions of this kind.",
"intro2":"This final year project formed much of the practical work needed in order to pass the MEng section of the Engineering Tripos with the Cambridge University Engineering Department.",
"3dsim":"Interact below to see the simulation results of the asymmetric, 3D case that involved an obstacle in the path of the collapse. Each particle here represents a 'material point' as per the Material Point Method.",
"3dcomp":"Simulations with different parameters were compared to lab measurements of the same collapse. To see the comparison more clearly each comparison is done at a cross section along the y-axis (perpendicular to the direction of collapse). The mesh size is given in units of the initial column depth (length along the direction of collapse) which was 50mm."}
